# Notes

This repository contains a sample project called Notes, a simple application where you can add/remove/edit personal notes. 

This project is used to illustrate how to do automated testing using Fastlane together with Travis CI. A full article is available at Medium with the name *iOS Automated Testing with Fastlane* that introduces the tool and explains the process.
